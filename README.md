1.) A common form that I come across while browsing the web are username and password forms. I almost see them everywhere while browsing. Many websites want you to subscribe in some sort of way because the more personal information they have about there users, the more they can appeal to them through discounts or promos
2.) Examples of text that arise are comment boxes and areas where you are prompted to expand your thoughts. Button boxes may consist of checkboxes and bullet points that require you to selected them.
3.)Some of my challenges on this assignment was getting stuck on specific code. When I cant figure something out right away I tent to lag on the specific problem for a good majority of time while I could continue on and come back to it after and potentially find the solution in upcoming code. As far as successes go I have found myself becoming more familiar with code conduct itself, therefor making less errors in general.
